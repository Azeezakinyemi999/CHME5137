# Topics and dates for 2025

## Lecture 1 - Friday September 5
* Introduction
* Meeting each other
* What we hope to learn, what we expect to cover
* Why modeling?
  - discovery (choose better experiments [sensitivity and uncertainty analyses]; do the impossible [ask "what if?"])
  - design (predict and simulate)
