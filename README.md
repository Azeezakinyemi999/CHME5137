# Syllabus
## CHME 5137 – Computational Modeling in Chemical Engineering
Instructor: 	Prof. Richard H. West   r.west@northeastern.edu
Fall 2016: 	Monday and Wednesday, 2:50 – 4:30pm,  124 Ryder

## Short Catalog Description:
Building on chemical engineering fundamentals, introduces computer programming to allow simulation of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Covers numerical experiments (eg. Monte Carlo, global sensitivity analysis) to learn the significance of parameters and model assumptions. Students work on a research or design project throughout the course.
Prerequisites: CHME3312 and CHME3322.

## Longer Description:
This course should equip chemical engineering students to create a computational model of any physical, chemical, or biological system, and perform numerical experiments on the model to learn the significance of parameters and model assumptions.  The course will integrate thermodynamics, kinetics, transport, and mathematics, with applications in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Faced with a modeling challenge, students will learn to define the problem, split it into sub-systems, develop mathematical models of each sub-system, implement these in Python, and thus construct a model to represent the whole process. Monte Carlo, uncertainty analysis, and global sensitivity analysis methods will then be used to test and learn from the model.  Students will also learn essential software carpentry skills, such as using the Linux command prompt, version control, and distributed computing on a cluster.

There will be assignments for each module, but primarily the assessment will be project based, with students working on their project throughout the semester. The final project report should be publication-quality, and students should expect to be able to submit to a peer-reviewed journal with minimal extra work.

Topics include:
*	Introduction to Python computer language, the Anaconda distribution, and a few libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
*	Using the command prompt and Linux terminal, and computer clusters.
*	Distributed version control with Git
*	Writing scientific reports with LaTeX
*	Basic Python programming
*	Importing, storing, manipulating, and exporting data
*	Solving nonlinear algebraic equations
*	Solving ordinary differential equations
*	Simulating chemical kinetics and thermodynamics with Cantera
*	Regression and machine learning; empirical models.
*	Monte Carlo simulations
*	Global and local sensitivity analysis
