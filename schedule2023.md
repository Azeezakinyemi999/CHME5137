# Topics and dates for 2023


## Lecture 1 Fri Sep 8
* Introduction
* What we hope to learn, what we expect to cover
* Why modeling?
  - discovery (choose better experiments [sensitivity and uncertainty analyses]; do the impossible [ask "what if?"])
  - design (predict and simulate)
* Project scope

## Homework 1 Fri Sep 8
* Start of semester survey.
