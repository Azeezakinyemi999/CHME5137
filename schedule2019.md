# Topics 

## Lecture 1 (9/6)
* Introduction
* What we hope to learn, what we expect to cover
* Why modeling?
  - discovery (choose better experiments [sensitivity and uncertainty analyses]; do the impossible [ask "what if?"])
  - design (predict and simulate)

## Lecture 2 (9/11)
* Python (using ipython in browser), Anaconda
* How to take notes (concepts? functions? demos?)
* Object types. (int/float/str/containers/boolean) 
* Duck typing.
* Loops (`for x in y:`), control flow (`if z:`)
* Functions
* Factorial!

### Homework 1 (9/13)
* CodingBat Python practice

## Lecture 3 (9/13)
* Differential equations, Simple Euler method to solve
* Numerical Convergence. How and why and when.

### Homework 2 (9/17)
* Runge-Kutta RK4 and convergence


## Lecture 4 (9/17)
* Runge-Kutta RK4
* Numpy arrays
* Projects brainstorm
* Fleshing out a project idea (how to cook an egg)

### Homework 3 (9/20)
* Flesh out a project

## Lecture 5 (9/20)
* `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`

### Homework 4
